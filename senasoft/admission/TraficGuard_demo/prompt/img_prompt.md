"Realistic top-down map of an urban area with roads, intersections, and a river crossing through the scene. Highlight six warning signs in triangular shapes with exclamation marks, placed at key points on the map to indicate caution zones. One of the warning signs should include a car crash icon to represent a traffic incident. Use muted colors for the map (grays, blues, and greens), and make the warning signs stand out in bright red and yellow. Include subtle textures to give the map a slightly worn or operational look, suitable for a traffic monitoring or urban safety simulation interface."
